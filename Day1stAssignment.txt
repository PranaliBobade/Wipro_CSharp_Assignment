Write the Pseudocode to Calculate the sum of digits of the number given by user
Eg: 456=4+5+6=15
 
2. Write the Pseudocode to calcualte the area of a rectangle, square and circle
 
3. Write the Pseudocode to calculate the average of 5 marks accepted from user. If the average is between 75-90 print excellent, 
60-75 print good and 45-60 pass below 45 fail

1.
Sum is initialize by zero 
using while loop 
if n is not equals to 0 then it will go inside and then calculate sum value
 sum = sum + n % 10;
            n = n / 10;
and return sum value and it will update Sum value and again check while until its not equal to zero.

2.
Main Function (main):

Initializes dimensions (length, width, radius) and calculates areas using respective functions.

Initialize length, width, and radius with specific values (5, 2, and 5 ) this is Assuming values "Enter the values).
Calculate the area of the rectangle using areaOfRectangle(length, width) and store the result in areaOfRect.
Print the calculated area of the rectangle.
Calculate the area of the square using areaOfSquare(length) and store the result in areaOfSquare.
Print the calculated area of the square.
Calculate the area of the circle using areaOfCircle(radius) and store the result in areaOfCircle.
Calculates the area of the circle.
Area Functions:
areaOfRectangle(length, width):
 Calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
Formula: area = length * width
areaOfSquare(side):
 Calculates the area of a square given its side length.
Formula: area = side * side
areaOfCircle(radius):
Purpose: Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.
Formula: area = Ï€ * (radius * radius) (approximated here as 3.14 * (radius * radius) ).
